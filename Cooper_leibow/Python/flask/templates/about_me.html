    <p>
      I am a new genius Python developer who has already done amazing things but who
      also seemed to have lost said things and am now starting from scratch.
      I seem to like losing things. It's fun to have to retrace your steps back to the very
      beginning. Makes me pull my hair out with excitement. </p>
