SELECT DATE_FORMAT(billing.charged_datetime, '%M') AS 'month', SUM(amount) as total_revenue
FROM billing
WHERE MONTH(billing.charged_datetime) = 3
AND YEAR(billing.charged_datetime) = 2012;

FROM sites
WHERE sites.client_id = 20
GROUP BY month_created, year_created;

What query would you run to get the total # of leads generated for each of the sites. between January 1, 2011 to February 15, 2011?
SELECT sites.domain_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS num_leads, DATE_FORMAT(leads.registered_datetime, '%M %d, %Y') AS date_registered

LEFT JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
WHERE leads.registered_datetime BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-02-15'

What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads. we've generated for each of our clients between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011?
SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS num_leads

Verify the previous query results using the query below...
SELECT *
FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON clients.id = sites.clients_id
JOIN leads ON sites.id = leads.sites_id
WHERE leads.registered_datetime BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-12-31';

What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads. we've generated for each client each month between months 1 - 6 of Year 2011?

WHERE leads.registered_datetime BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-06-30'
GROUP BY clients.client_id, MONTH(leads.registered_datetime)
ORDER BY MONTH(leads.registered_datetime);

verify the above query results with the query below...
SELECT clients.first_name, clients.last_name, leads.*
FROM clients
JOIN sites ON clients.id = sites.clients_id
JOIN leads ON sites.id = leads.sites_id
WHERE leads.registered_datetime BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-06-30'
ORDER BY leads.registered_datetime;

What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads
we've generated for each of our clients' sites between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011?
Order it by clients id
SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, sites.domain_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS num_leads, DATE_FORMAT(leads.registered_datetime, '%M %d, %Y') AS date_generated
FROM clients
JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
LEFT JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
WHERE leads.registered_datetime BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-12-31'
GROUP BY sites.domain_name
ORDER BY clients.client_id;

Come up with a second query that shows all the clients, the site name(s),
and the total number of leads generated from each site for all time.
SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, sites.domain_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS num_leads
FROM clients
JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
LEFT JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
GROUP BY clients.client_id, sites.domain_name;

Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each client for each month of the year. Order by client id.
SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, SUM(billing.amount) AS monthly_revenue, DATE_FORMAT(billing.charged_datetime, '%M') AS 'month', DATE_FORMAT(billing.charged_datetime, '%Y') AS 'year'
FROM clients
LEFT JOIN billing ON clients.client_id = billing.client_id
GROUP BY client_name, MONTH(billing.charged_datetime), YEAR(billing.charged_datetime)
ORDER BY clients.client_id;

Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client owns.
Group the results so that each row shows a new client. It will become clearer when you
add a new field called 'sites' that has all the sites that the client owns. (HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)
SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, GROUP_CONCAT(sites.domain_name) AS 'sites'
FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
GROUP BY clients.client_id;
